CharmCityAR is proud to announce the artist-in-residence for June 2017. CharmCityAR is excited to announce our first artist ever, PK, who is our chosen artist-in-residence. From June 9th until 19th, PK will enjoy complete freedom to make art.  

They will enjoy complete solitude, solace, pool access, gym access, and lounge access in this residency, in addition to being provided with the basic necessities, so that they can make art undisturbed. All in one place, the CharmCityAR is a true retreat within Baltimore City. 

It's our pleasure to host PK!
