Welcome to the Charm City Artist Residency! 

The CharmCityAR is a unique opportunity for solitude & solace for artists of any kind in the Baltimore area. All chosen residents will recieve a key to a studio apartment for a specified period of time to create art. Their creations will be profiled on this site, in addition to a profile of the artist and their experience with the residency. 

This marks the first round of the CharmCityAR ever! 

CharmCityAR is excited to announce that PK is the chosen artist-in-residence for June 9th until 19th. They will enjoy complete solitude, pool access, gym access, and lounge access in the building where the residency takes place, in addition to the basics so that they can complete art undisturbed. 

With a full kitchen, laundry machines, and shower, CharmCityAR is equipped to make even the basics easy for creatives. All in one place, the CharmCityAR is a true retreat within Baltimore City. 

It's our pleasure to host PK!
