CharmCityAR is proud to announce the artist-in-residence for June 2017. This marks the first round of the CharmCityAR ever! CharmCityAR is excited to announce that PK is the chosen artist-in-residence from June 9th until 19th. 

They will enjoy complete solitude, solace, pool access, gym access, and lounge access in this residency, in addition to being provided with the basic necessities, so that they can make art undisturbed. All in one place, the CharmCityAR is a true retreat within Baltimore City. 

It's our pleasure to host PK!
